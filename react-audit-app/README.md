### Preferred Language, Framework and Library

I chose React(JavaScript) as the preferred language for this project because of its popularity, flexibility, and component-based architecture. React is a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it has a large and active community, which means there are plenty of resources, libraries, and support available.

Here are the frameworks and libraries used in the project and why they were chosen:

1. React: As mentioned earlier, React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based approach allows for modular and reusable code, making it easier to manage and maintain complex UIs.

2. react-router-dom: This library provides routing capabilities for React applications. It allows us to create multiple pages and navigate between them using URLs. I used this library to handle the routing between the first page and the second page of the form.

3. styled-components: Styled-components is a popular CSS-in-JS library that allows us to write CSS directly within our JavaScript code using tagged template literals. I used it to style the components in a more organized and modular way. It also supports dynamic styles based on props, which is helpful for conditional styling.

4. react-responsive-carousel: This library provides a responsive and customizable carousel component for React applications. I used it to implement the image slider on the first page of the form.

5. pdfmake: pdfmake is a library that allows generating PDF documents in the browser. I used it to create a PDF document with the form data on the second page when the user clicks the submit button.

Overall, these libraries were chosen to enhance the development process and provide a better user experience for the form application. React, with its component-based architecture, made it easy to build and manage the form's UI, while the other libraries added specific functionalities, such as routing, styling, carousel, and PDF generation, to create a complete and efficient application.
